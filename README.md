# Worldthreader Mod

This project is a free and open-source Minecraft mod which optimizes the processing of multiple dimensions, by ticking
dimensions in parallel on one thread each. Thread safety of operations like teleporting between dimensions or executing
commands which affect another dimension is ensured. After each tick the dimensions wait for each other to ensure that
all dimensions run at the same speed to avoid breaking interdimensional timing sensitive redstone contraptions. More
work is required on thread-safe updating game rules, scoreboards, the world border and similar shared data.

The mod works on both the **client and server**, and **does not** require the mod to be installed on both sides.

### FAQ

##### Does the mod change Vanilla behaviour?

Worldthreader aims to conserve vanilla-parity in most points. Behavior that is based on the timing

##### Can my dimensions get de-synchronized?

As stated above this is **NOT** the case. Worldthreader will always synchronize the dimensions it threads with each
other, setting the overall MSPT to the slowest individual dimension.

##### Are dimension counts above 3 supported?

Yes.

##### Can I use Worldthreader if I have fewer threads on my CPU than dimensions?

Yes, but that will reduce the performance.

##### How is the compatibility with other mods?

Compatibility issues with other mods will be very common. Often these issues cannot be fixed by this mod, but instead
the other mods have to adjust. The author of Worldthreader is willing to cooperate and suggest changes to other mods for
compatibility.

##### What about older versions of Minecraft?

There is the DimThread mod which supports a few older versions: https://github.com/WearBlackAllDay/DimensionalThreading
