# DimensionalThreading 

This project is a free and open-source Minecraft mod which optimizes the processing of multiple Dimensions, by assigning them independent threads.
It works on both the **client and server**, and **does not** require the mod to be installed on both sides.

### Downloads

You can find downloads for DimThread on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/WearBlackAllDay/DimensionalThreading/releases). 
The Fabric API can be found on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

### Configuration

##### DimThread comes with 2 native Gamerules:
- `/gamerule dimthread_active <true/false>` enables/disables the mod
- `/gamerule dimthread_thread_count <count>`changes the amount of threads used

### FAQ

##### Does the mod change Vanilla behaviour?
DimThread aims to conserve vanilla-parity in all points. At the moment there are no known deviations in behaviour from Mojangs`server.jar`. If you notice any, feel free to [open an issue.](https://github.com/WearBlackAllDay/DimensionalThreading/issues)

##### Can my dimensions get de-synchronized?
As stated above this is **NOT** the case. DimThread will always synchronize the dimensions it threads with each other, setting the overall MSPT to the slowest individual dimension.

##### Are dimension counts above 3 supported?
Yes, but you will have to adjust the GameRule accordingly.

##### Will the server run faster if assign more than 3 threads to DimThread?
No, the mod can only assign one dimension to one thread.

##### Can i use DimThread if i have less threads on my CPU than dimensions?
The mod will not crash if you do not have enough threads available, but it will make the game **slower**. You should always have atleast`DimensionCount + 1`threads available.

##### What about older versions of Minecraft?
DimThread is written with 1.16 compatibility in mind, older versions are currently not considered. If you play on 1.12 you can use a similar project maintained by [2No2Name](https://github.com/2No2Name).
